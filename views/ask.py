"""Ask Tiresias: a grounded text-to-SQL chat over the Seattle-metro marts.

Replaces the earlier "Ask the data" page. The engine, prompts, SQL guard (table
allowlist, SELECT-only, row cap, timeout) and abuse guards live in the pinned
``tiresias`` library; this page points it at ``tiresias.yml``. Without an
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` the page shows a notice and stops. Caps can be tuned with
``TIRESIAS_MAX_*``.
